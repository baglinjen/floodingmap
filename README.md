### Set up environment variables
To run the project correctly you must set three environment variables:
- "DBNAME" : the name of the postgres database that you are using
- "DBUSER" : the username of the authentication to the database
- "DBPASSWORD" : the password of the authentication to the database

**If your database is not set up, you can utilize the DatabaseTool from tools project to seed a postgres database**
